# DataSync S3 Transfer
Automate S3 object transfers between buckets via DataSync!

> ðŸš§ This guide is under construction. ðŸš§

## Use Case

- Transfer S3 objects between AWS S3 buckets via DataSync, without having to click around the AWS Console.
- S3 transfer can be between buckets in the same AWS accounts, or across different accounts.
- The necessary DataSync resources are generated for you, so you you don't have to.
- Create automation scripts using this package, to initiate batch DataSync transfers between many buckets.

## System Design

```mermaid

    start(((Start)))
    in[/Source and destination buckets,\nAWS creds, DataSync options, etc./]
    policy[[Update destination\nbucket policy]]
    srcloc[[Create DataSync\nsource S3 location]]
    destloc[[Create DataSync\ndestination S3 location]]
    task[[Create DataSync\ntransfer task]]
    exec[[Execute\ntransfer task]]
    out[/DataSync\nresources/]
    stop(((Stop)))

    start -- input --> in
    in --> policy
    in --> srcloc
    in --> destloc
    srcloc --> task
    destloc --> task
    policy --> destloc
    task --> exec
    exec -- output --> out
    out --> stop
```

## Transfer Assumptions

There are assumptions made in the making of this project. If any assumptions
are not met, then this package may not work for you.

- For cross-account bucket transfers, where the source and destination buckets
  belong to different AWS accounts, it is the source AWS account that initiates
  the transfer to the destination account.
- The source AWS config provided, is assumed to be an IAM user who has the
  necessary permissions to perform DataSync-related actions. For more
  information on the required permissions, see [Tutorial: Transferring data from Amazon S3 to Amazon S3 across AWS accounts - AWS DataSync][1].
